The different parameters used are described below.

| Parameter | Description |
|---------|---------|
| Element name   | The name in the element stored in the solver     |
| Right and Left Boundary condition     | Set the Left and right boundary condition for this element     |
| Initial condition     | Initial condition for this element     |
| Length Velocity     | The length of the velocity space for this element. The velocity space is [-Lv, +Lv]     |
| Z charge     | The Z charge of the element     |
| Ratio of mass     | The ratio of mass with an electron (me/mi)     |
